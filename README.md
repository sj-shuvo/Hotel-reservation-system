Hotel Management System Project.

Project Description:

This Hotel Management System is a console-based application designed in C to manage the core functions of a hotel, such as room booking, checking room availability, viewing reservations, customer checkouts, generating revenue reports, and parking management. The program provides a simple interface for administrators to manage room allocations, track customer details, and calculate billing information efficiently.

Key Features:

1. Room Booking : Enables administrators to book available rooms by room type (Standard, Deluxe, Suite) with dynamic room allocation. 

2. Room Availability Check : Allows users to check room availability by type or specific room number, giving a clear view of room occupancy.   

3. Reservation Management : View all reservations, search by customer ID, edit existing records, and cancel reservations as needed.

4. Customer Checkout : Calculates total charges based on room type, number of nights stayed, and optional parking services.

5. Revenue Report : Generates a revenue summary from room and parking charges, helping administrators track income.

6. Parking Management : Displays parking availability, tracks occupied parking slots, and calculates parking fees.

7. Login System : Provides a basic login functionality for secure access to the hotel management system.




Limitations:

Data Persistence : Since data is stored in memory, it is lost when the program exits. Thereâ€™s no persistent storage like a database or file system.

Limited Room Categories : Only three room types (Standard, Deluxe, Suite) are supported. Expanding this would require additional code modifications.

Basic Login System : The login system uses a simple hardcoded username and password. It lacks robust security measures.

Console-Based Interface : The program runs in a console environment, which can be less intuitive than a graphical user interface.

Fixed Parking Slot Limit : The parking management is limited to 20 slots, which could be adjusted dynamically based on hotel capacity.
